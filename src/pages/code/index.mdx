In the course of helping clients and testing new ideas for ourselves,
the GSE team produces a variety of tools and automation scripts
that might be useful to you. Most of them are housed in github
repos. They are provided as is. If you have problems or suggestions,
please raise
a github issue on the associated repo. Support will be on a best
effort basis.

### **Application Modernization**

Application modernization is the journey of moving existing
applications to a more modern cloud-native infrastructure.
[The Modernization Playbook](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/)
describes and provides code for 3 scenarios:

1. [Runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/liberty)
moves an application to a "built for the cloud" runtime with
the least amount of effort.

2. [Spring runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/spring/README)
describes the process of upgrading
existing Spring Framework and Spring Boot v1 applications
to use Spring Boot v2.

3. [Operational modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/was90/README)
is where the application is made to run in a container
without any
change.

### **Application Migration**

The [Cloud Foundry Migration Tool](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cf-transformation)
assists you in migrating Cloud Foundry applications to
Kubernetes based platforms, such as OpenShift, and IBM
Kubernetes Service (IKS). There is also a
[short course](https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/) with
video demos teaching how to use the tool by migrating some
provided sample applications. Just search on
"cloud foundry migration".

### **Digital Business Automation**

[Denim Compute](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/denim-compute),
A Digital Business Automation reference implementation on
the IBM Cloud Pak for Automation. This reference implementation
uses the IBM Cloud Pak for Automation to exemplify how the
different capabilities of the IBM Digital Business Automation
platform come together on a container-centric management
environment to support the execution of a complex business
process.

### **DevOps**

[GSE DevOps Staging Page](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/gse-devops)
contains tutorials and configurations for implementing Tekton
and other pipelines.

### **Event Driven Architecture**

[Reefer Container Shipment](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
reference implementation. This IBM Event Driven architecture
reference implementation
illustrates the deployment of real time analytics on event
streams in the context of container shipment in an
[event driven architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/)
with event backbone, functions as service
and microservices. It aims to illustrate the different event
driven patterns like event sourcing, CQRS and Saga and give
a lot of best practices around implementing event driven
microservices.

### **General**

[Cloud User ID Resource Management Scripts](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloud-user-resource-scripts)
contains a set of shell scripts that, for a range of public cloud user ids,
can create, report on, and delete cloud services, applications and other resources
in an automated way. These scripts could be useful for anyone who needs to
consistently manage cloud resources under a set of user ids, for education
courses or other situations.

### **Code Example**

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pvc[^1]
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce[^2]
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi[^3]
```
[^1]: A unique name that represents the PersistentVolumeClaim.
[^2]: The PersistentVolumeClaim's access mode. With `ReadWriteOnce`,
the volume can be mounted with read and write permissioms by a single node.
[^3]: The size of the PersistentVolumeClaim.
