In the course of helping clients and testing new ideas for ourselves,
the GSE team produces a variety of tools and automation scripts
that might be useful to you. Most of them are housed in github 
repos. They are provided as is. If you have problems or suggestions, 
please raise
a github issue on the associated repo. Support will be on a best
effort basis.

### **Application Modernization**

Application modernization is the journey of moving existing 
applications to a more modern cloud-native infrastructure.
[This reference solution page](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/)
describes and provides code for 3 scenarios:

1. [Runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/liberty/)
moves an application to a "built for the cloud" runtime with 
the least amount of effort.

2. [Spring runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/spring/)
describes the process of upgrading 
existing Spring Framework and Spring Boot v1 applications 
to use Spring Boot v2.

3. [Operational modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/was90/)
is where the application is made to run in a container 
without any
change.

### **Application Migration**

The [Cloud Foundry Migration Tool](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cf-transformation)
assists you in migrating Cloud Foundry applications to 
Kubernetes based platforms, such as OpenShift, and IBM 
Kubernetes Service (IKS). There is also a 
[short course](https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/) with
video demos teaching how to use the tool by migrating some
provided sample applications. Just search on 
"cloud foundry migration".

### **Digital Business Automation**

[Denim Compute](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/denim-compute),
A Digital Business Automation reference implementation on 
the IBM Cloud Pak for Automation. This reference implementation 
uses the IBM Cloud Pak for Automation to exemplify how the 
different capabilities of the IBM Digital Business Automation 
platform come together on a container-centric management 
environment to support the execution of a complex business 
process.

### **DevOps**

[GSE DevOps Staging Page](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/gse-devops)
contains tutorials and configurations for implementing Tekton
and other pipelines.

### **Event Driven Architecture**

[Reefer Container Shipment](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
reference implementation. This IBM Event Driven architecture 
reference implementation 
illustrates the deployment of real time analytics on event 
streams in the context of container shipment in an 
[event driven architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/) 
with event backbone, functions as service 
and microservices. It aims to illustrate the different event 
driven patterns like event sourcing, CQRS and Saga and give 
a lot of best practices around implementing event driven 
microservices.
