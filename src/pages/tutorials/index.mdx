### **Application Modernization**

1. [Runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/liberty)
moves an application to a "built for the cloud" runtime with the least amount of effort.

2. [Spring runtime modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/spring/README)
describes the process of upgrading existing Spring Framework and Spring Boot v1 applications to use Spring Boot v2.

3. [Operational modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/was90/README)
is where the application is made to run in a container without any change.
