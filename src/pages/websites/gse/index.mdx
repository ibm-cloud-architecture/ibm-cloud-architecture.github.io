### **IBM Cloud Pak Playbook**

[IBM Cloud Pak Playbook](https://cloudpak8s.io) provides
the latest installation, configuration, and scenario information
for all IBM Cloud Paks on OpenShift 4. An
[earlier version](https://ocp311.cloudpak8s.io) of the
Cloud Pak Playbook, documenting
Cloud Pak versions running on OpenShift 3.11, is still
available.
- The [IBM Cloud Pak Playbook](https://cloudpak8s.io) now contains a
comprehensive section on [Day 2 Operations](https://cloudpak8s.io/day2/Introduction/)
for OpenShift Container Platform installations.

### **Modernization Playbook**
The [Modernization Playbook](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/) provides a guide to modernizing existing applications built on IBM middleware including WebSphere, MQ and IBM Integration Bus. The playbook describes the steps to analyze and then modernize and deploy applications to run in Containers on Red Hat OpenShift using the latest technologies. The following tutorials provide step-by-step instructions that can be used to help with modernizing your applications:
- [Runtime Modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/liberty) uses the WebSphere Liberty runtime in a Container
- [Operational Modernization](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/was90/README) uses the traditional WebSphere runtime in a Container

### **Event Driven Reference Architecture**

[Event Driven Reference Architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/)
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern
that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and
reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied
to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled
software components and services.
Some subsections of the site deal with particular elements of
event driven architecture:
- [Event Storming Methodology](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/methodology/readme/)
- [Event Storming Analysis](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/analysis/readme/)
applied to the
[Reefer Container Shipment](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
reference application.
- [Process continuous streaming events for real time analytics](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/rt-analytics/)

### **IBM Garage Cloud Native Bootcamp**

[IBM Garage Cloud Native Bootcamp](https://cloudnative101.dev)
is a self-study course
designed to enable developers with the latest
tools and techniques for developing cloud native applications.
